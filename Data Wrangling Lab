In this assignment you will be performing data wrangling.

Objectives
In this lab you will perform the following:

Identify duplicate values in the dataset.

Remove duplicate values from the dataset.

Identify missing values in the dataset.

Impute the missing values in the dataset.

Normalize data in the dataset.

Hands on Lab
Import pandas module.

import pandas as pd
Load the dataset into a dataframe.

df = pd.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/LargeData/m1_survey_data.csv")
Finding duplicates
In this section you will identify duplicate values in the dataset.

Find how many duplicate rows exist in the dataframe.

# your code goes here
duplicate = df[df.duplicated()]  

print("Duplicate Rows :", duplicate)

Imputing missing values
Find the value counts for the column WorkLoc.

df['WorkLoc'].value_counts()
Office                                            6806
Home                                              3589
Other place, such as a coworking space or cafe     971
Name: WorkLoc, dtype: int64
Identify the value that is most frequent (majority) in the WorkLoc column.

#make a note of the majority value here, for future reference
df['UndergradMajor'].value_counts().idxmin()
'A health science (ex. nursing, pharmacy, radiology)'
Impute (replace) all the empty rows in the column WorkLoc with the value that you have identified as majority.

# your code goes here
import numpy as np
df["WorkLoc"].replace(np.nan, "Office", inplace=True)
After imputation there should ideally not be any empty rows in the WorkLoc column.

Verify if imputing was successful.

# your code goes here
df['WorkLoc'].isnull().sum()

Normalizing data
There are two columns in the dataset that talk about compensation.

One is "CompFreq". This column shows how often a developer is paid (Yearly, Monthly, Weekly).

The other is "CompTotal". This column talks about how much the developer is paid per Year, Month, or Week depending upon his/her "CompFreq".

This makes it difficult to compare the total compensation of the developers.

In this section you will create a new column called 'NormalizedAnnualCompensation' which contains the 'Annual Compensation' irrespective of the 'CompFreq'.

Once this column is ready, it makes comparison of salaries easy.

List out the various categories in the column 'CompFreq'

# your code goes here
df.CompFreq.value_counts()
Yearly     6073
Monthly    4788
Weekly      331
Name: CompFreq, dtype: int64
Create a new column named 'NormalizedAnnualCompensation'. Use the hint given below if needed.
